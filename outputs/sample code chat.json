    "query": "What is the accuracy of BERT embeddings for redundancy detection?",
    "response": "The provided context does not contain information about the specific accuracy of BERT embeddings for redundancy detection. However, it does state that BERT embeddings outperform Avg Word2Vec by identifying 25 additional redundancies and that BERT is highly effective for redundancy detection as it identifies subtle similarities that traditional methods often overlook."

    "query": "How does the system detect redundancy in software requirements?",
    "response": "The system detects redundancy in software requirements using two approaches:\n\n1.  **Avg Word2Vec:** This method calculates the average word embeddings for each requirement and uses a similarity metric (such as cosine similarity) to identify redundancy.\n2.  **BERT Embeddings:** This method uses deep contextualized embeddings and determines redundancy between requirement pairs based on either Euclidean distance or cosine similarity. Sentences exceeding a similarity criterion (e.g., >0.8) are marked as redundant."

    "timestamp": "20:56:26",
    "query": "What are the main evaluation metrics used in this study?",
    "response": "The context mentions the evaluation of redundancy detection using Avg Word2Vec and BERT Embeddings, focusing on their efficacy and precision in identifying redundant requirements. The primary metric appears to be the number of redundant requirements identified by each method. The study also highlights the ability of BERT embeddings to capture contextual linkages missed by Avg Word2Vec, suggesting that the quality of the identified redundancies (i.e., whether they are semantically similar rather than just syntactically similar) is another key evaluation aspect."

  {
    "timestamp": "20:56:31",
    "query": "Summarize the methodology used for requirement analysis",
    "response": "The methodology for requirement analysis involves:\n\n1.  **Preprocessing:** This includes tokenization (splitting text into words), stopword removal (removing common words), lemmatization (reducing words to their root form), and sentence splitting.\n2.  **Feature Extraction:** Numerical embeddings are generated for each requirement sentence using TF-IDF, Word2Vec, and BERT embeddings.\n3.  **Computation of Similarity:** Cosine similarity is used to measure the similarity between requirement pairs based on the generated embeddings.\n4.  **Redundancy Reporting:** A report is produced that highlights duplicate needs based on cosine similarity thresholds. Sentences with duplicates are identified for evaluation and validation."

    "timestamp": "20:56:37",
    "query": "What are the advantages of using BERT over traditional methods?",
    "response": "Based on the context:\n\nBERT's advantages over traditional methods for redundancy detection are:\n\n*   **Captures bidirectional and contextual relationships between words:** BERT embeddings enable semantic text representation, allowing it to identify subtle similarities that traditional methods often overlook.\n*   **Improved accuracy in tasks such as text classification and semantic similarity detection:** BERT has demonstrated significant improvements in these tasks in the context of SRS analysis.\n*   **Handles complex language and domain-specific terminology effectively:** FinBERT, a BERT model fine-tuned for financial text, has shown the ability to do this.\n*   **Profound contextual awareness:** BERT greatly raises the precision and effectiveness of ambiguity and redundancy identification in SRS texts."

    "response": "The BERT embeddings method outperforms Avg Word2Vec by identifying 25 additional redundancies. The context also suggests future work could involve fine-tuning BERT models for specific domains to further improve redundancy detection accuracy."
